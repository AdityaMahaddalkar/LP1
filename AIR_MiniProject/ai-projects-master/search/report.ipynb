    "The [eight puzzle](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jrichar4/8puz.html) provides an ideal environment for exploring one of the fundamental problems in Artificial Intelligence: searching for the optimal solution path. Although the eight puzzle is a simplified environment, the general techniques of search employed to find the solution can translate into many domains, including [laying out components on a computer chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration) or finding the [best route between two cities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/computing-the-shortest-path-a-search-meets-graph-theory/). Two different search strategies were explored in this project: [a-star](http://web.mit.edu/eranki/www/tutorials/search/) and [local beam search](http://aicat.inf.ed.ac.uk/entry.php?id=660). A-star search was tested with 2 heuristics, while local beam was tested with several values for the beam width. "

    "The complete project was coded in Python. The eight_puzzle was implemented as a class with attributes to represent the state of board, a number of utility methods to aid in the solution of the puzzle and visualizing the solution path, and most importantly, the two methods for solving the puzzle. The solution of the eight puzzle is the sequence of blank tile moves that lead from the starting state to the goal state. As the solution is a path, my approach used Python dictionaries to keep track of all nodes considered in each search. Each node includes the current state (the position of all tiles on the board), the parent state, and the action required to get from the parent state to the child state. When the goal state is reached, the algorithm can then transverse backwards through the dictionary starting at the goal state and linking each child state to its parent while recording the series of moves of the blank tile. This solution path can then be displayed and the length of the solution path can be determined. The efficiency of each search can be quantified with an effective branching factor calculated using the length of the solution path and the number of nodes generated during the search. \n",

If the move satisfies these conditions, the total cost of the move is then evaluated by taking the path cost of the resulting state plus the heuristic of the resulting state (see background on A-Star below). The state that results from the move is then added to the priority queue and at the end of the iteration, the priority queue is sorted by total cost. At the end of each iteration, the best state is chosen from the front of the priority queue and expanded. The node that is expanded will then be added to the expanded_nodes dictionary in order to generate the solution path at the end of the loop. The states that are not expanded on an iteration will be added to the frontier in order to keep track of which nodes have been generated but not expanded. The goal check occurs when a node is expanded rather than when it is generated because it might be possible that the first time the goal state is encountered is not the lowest cost path to the goal. Once a solution is found, the expanded_nodes dictionary is passed to another function that generates and displays the solution path.  The total number of nodes generated is the sum of the nodes in the frontier_nodes dictionary and the expanded_nodes dictionary. \n",

    "### Background on A-star search\n",
    "\n",
    "A-star search is a powerful algorithm for finding an optimal solution path. A-star search chooses the next state based on the total cost of all nodes on the frontier (those that have been generated but not yet expanded). The total cost of a node is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(state) = g(state) + h(state) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "f(state), the total cost of the state, is the sum of g(state), the path cost to get to the state, and h(state), the heuristic function evaluated at the state. In the eight puzzle, the path cost is simply the depth of the state, or the number of moves to get from the start state to the goal state because each move incurs the same cost. The heuristic is either h1, the number of tiles misplaced from their position in the goal state, or h2, the sum of the [Manhattan distances](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) of all tiles from their position in the goal state. The heuristic is essentially an estimate of the remaining path distance from the state to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A-star implements a priority queue, where the frontier nodes in the queue are ordered by total cost with the lowest cost nodes at the front of the queue. Each iteration, the lowest cost node (first in the queue) is expanded and then removed from the queue. My algorithm implements a priority queue, as well as a dictionary to keep track of the expanded nodes and a dictionary to keep track of the nodes on the frontier. The solution path is the sequence of actions from the start state to the goal state, the solution length is the number of actions required, and the number of nodes considered is the number of nodes expanded plus the number of nodes on the frontier. \n",
    "\n",
    "A-star search is optimal (it finds the shortest solution path) and complete if the heuristic is both [admissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic) and [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_heuristic). Admissibility means that the heuristic never overestimates the distance to the goal state. A heuristic is consistent if the estimate to the goal for any node is always less than or equal to the estimate to the goal for any neighboring vertex plus the path cost of reaching that vertex. (This is a general form of the triangle inequality). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the h1 and h2 heuristics are admissible and consistent guaranteeing that they will find the optimal solution if it exists. However, the two heuristics are not equally efficient as will be demonstrated in the calculation of the effective branching factors. "

Each iteration, all successor states of all current states are generated by finding all available moves. Each successor state is then checked to make sure that it has not already been considered. It if has not, then the algorithm will find the total cost of the state using the evaluation function (see Local Beam Search Background below). The successor states are then added to the priority queue and the queue is sorted by total cost. At the end of the iteration, the k best states (the width of the beam search) are retained from the list of successor states. The k best states then become the current states from which to generate all possible successor states on the next iteration. All nodes are added to a dictionary in order to find the solution path when the loop ends.

    "Local beam search implements a priority queue as in a-star search, but the evaluation function does not take into account the path cost to reach the state. The evaluation function can be defined in any manner as long as it is zero at the goal state. The evaluation function I developed for local beam search is \n",

    "Where f(state) represents the total cost of the state, h1(state) represents the number of misplaced tiles from the goal state of the state, and h2 represents the sum of the Manhattan distances of the tiles in the state from the goal state. This evaluation function was selected because the h1 and h2 heuristics are both consistent and admissible and work well for solving a-star. \n",
    "\n",
    "A-star considers the path cost to each state when ranking the states whereas local beam only considers the evaluation function of the successor states. In effect, local beam is \"blind\" to the past and to any future beyond the next step (a-star is also \"blind\" to the future beyond the next step.) At each iteration, local beam search will calculate the total cost of all successors of all current states and order the successor states by lowest to highest cost. The algorithm will then retain the \"k\" best states for the next iteration. This limits the amount of states that need to be kept in memory. Local beam search with $k = 1$ is equivalent to hill climbing because the algorithm will just select the successor state with the lowest evaluation function. Local beam search with $k=\\infty$ is equal to breadth first search because the algorithm will expand every single state at the current depth before moving deeper in the search tree."

    "The eight puzzle is a wonderful problem for exploring the basics of search algorithms. In this project, I solved the eight puzzle using a-star seach with two different heuristics, and using local beam with two beam widths. Further work on the eight puzzle could involve solving the puzzle using a-star search informed by a more sophisticated heuristic such as [that developed by](https://cse.sc.edu/~mgv/csce580sp15/gradPres/HanssonMayerYung1992.pdf) Hanson et al in 1992. Other intriuging avenues for exploring the eight puzzle could involve training a neural network to solve the puzzle using the sequence of actions as a label and the starting state as a feature. Graduate work [done by Peterson in 2013](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece539/fall13/project/Peterson_rpt.pdf) used neural networks to attempt to derive a better heuristic for the eight puzzle. I would like to acknowledge the help provided by the resources linked to in the report as well as the textbook [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) written by Russell and Norvig. I thoroughly enjoyed developing an eight puzzle solver using search algorithms and am looking forward to greater challenges in the field of artificial intelligence."
